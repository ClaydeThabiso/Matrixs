# 🧮 Matrix Calculator – JavaFX

A GUI-based Matrix Calculator built using **JavaFX** that allows users to dynamically generate matrices and perform various matrix operations through an interactive interface.

This project demonstrates strong understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming, Generics, Exception Handling, and Event-Driven GUI Design in Java**.
